### **Name of the Project**:
DutyCircle

### **List of Team Members**:
Nico Lawani

### **Description of the Project**:
DutyCircle is a unique application designed to merge task management with public accountability. Users can create and manage personal tasks while also choosing to share them publicly. The public sharing feature transforms a simple task into a commitment, offering users an external motivation to accomplish their goals. The public feed showcases tasks from various users, giving an opportunity for users to connect over shared objectives or interests. Users can form accountability circles where they can nudge each other for pending tasks, strengthening the community feel and adding an extra layer of motivation.

### **Learning Objectives**:
1. **Integration of Frontend and Backend**: Achieve a seamless interaction between the Next.js frontend and the Postgresql backend.
2. **Understanding Public Accountability**: Delve into the psychological aspects of public commitment and its impact on task completion rates.
3. **Mastering Next.js**: Grasp the capabilities of Next.js including SSR, API routes, and the broader ecosystem.
4. **Database Management**: Learn efficient task management and user interaction storage using Postgresql.

### **Technologies Used**:
1. **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework)
2. **Backend**: Built-in API routes provided by Next.js
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL

### **Third Party Services Used**:
1. **Deployment**: Vercel for Next.js and Neondb for PostgreSQL.
2. **Authentication**: Used NextAuth Authentication for user login and registration.
3. **Notifications**: (If in future iterations) Services like SendGrid for email notifications or Twilio for SMS.

### **Challenges Already Identified**:
1. **Scalability**: As the number of users grows, ensuring that the app's performance remains consistent.
2. **Nudges and Notifications**: Creating a system where nudges don't become spammy or counter-productive.
3. **Learning Curve**: Mastering Next.js and its features while integrating with PostgreSQL.
4. **Real-time Updates**: If considering real-time features in future iterations, the challenge of implementing and managing WebSocket connections or similar solutions.


### **SUCCESSES**:
1. Successfully built a feed currently sorted by most recent public tasks posted.
2. Successfully implemented authentication using NextAuth.
3. Successfully implemented a PostgreSQL database with tables for users, tasks, and circles.
4. Successfully implemented a task creation form with a public/private toggle.

### **CHALLENGES**:
1. Implementing a feed that's actually meaningful to users(current feed is still a work in progress).

### **AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**:
1. Implementing a feed that's actually meaningful to users(current feed is still a work in progress).
2. Implementing a notification system that nudges users to complete their tasks.
3. Implementing a system for users to form accountability circles.
4. Implementing a system for users to follow other users.
5. Implementing a system for users to like/comment on tasks.
6. Implementing a system for users to share tasks on other platforms.
7. Implementing a system for users to create recurring tasks.
8. Implementing a system for users to create subtasks.

### **LESSONS LEARNED**:
1. **Next.js**: I learned how to use Next.js and its features including API routes, SSR, and the broader ecosystem.
2. **PostgreSQL**: I learned how to use PostgreSQL and its features including tables, queries, and the broader ecosystem.
3. **NextAuth**: I learned how to use NextAuth for authentication and user management.
4. **Deployment**: I learned how to deploy a Next.js app on Vercel and a PostgreSQL database on Neondb.
5. **Public Accountability**: I learned about the psychological aspects of public commitment and its impact on task completion rates.

### **NEXT STEPS**:
1. Cleanup and carrying out a code review.
2. Improving the app according to the feedback received.

### **CONCLUSION**:
Overall, I'm happy with the progress I've made on the app. I've learned a lot about Next.js, PostgreSQL, and public accountability. I'm looking forward to improving the app and making it more meaningful to users.
