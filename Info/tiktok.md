Creating a TikTok video based on the tweet can be a fun and engaging way to introduce your project. Here's a storyboard for a potential TikTok video based on the tweet:

### **TikTok Video Idea for #DutyCircle**:

#### **Scene 1**:
*Visual*: Close-up of a hand writing tasks on a to-do list.  
*Audio*: Soft background music with a ticking clock sound.

#### **Scene 2**:
*Visual*: Zoom out showing the list getting longer, papers scattered, and the person looking stressed.  
*Audio*: Voice-over: "Ever felt the weight of unchecked to-do lists?"

#### **Scene 3**:
*Visual*: Switch to a dark room, with only the light of a laptop illuminating the user's face, showing them working alone.  
*Audio*: Voice-over: "...and no one to push you?"

#### **Scene 4**:
*Visual*: Animation or graphic of the DutyCircle app logo.  
*Audio*: Upbeat music starts. Voice-over: "Introducing... DutyCircle!"

#### **Scene 5**:
*Visual*: Quick montage or animation showing tasks being added, and user profiles forming a circle around a task.  
*Audio*: Voice-over: "Where your tasks meet accountability from a circle of peers."

#### **Scene 6**:
*Visual*: Show notifications on a phone of encouragements or "nudges" from other users.  
*Audio*: Notification sound effects. Voice-over: "Get nudged, stay motivated!"

#### **Scene 7**:
*Visual*: Show a task being checked off with a mini celebration animation.  
*Audio*: Sound effect of celebration (cheers or applause). Voice-over: "Every goal deserves a cheer squad!"

#### **Scene 8**:
*Visual*: A call to action, perhaps showing a "Coming Soon" sign and a QR code or link to a landing page.  
*Audio*: Voice-over: "Would you use it? Let me know below! #DutyCircle ðŸš€"

**Tips**:

1. **Engagement**: Encourage comments and feedback at the end of the video.
2. **Use Hashtags**: Incorporate trending or relevant hashtags to increase the video's reach.
3. **Keep It Short**: TikTok videos work best when they're concise, engaging, and to the point.
4. **Music**: Choose a catchy, upbeat song from TikTok's library to keep viewers engaged.

Once you have the storyboard and the idea clear, you can either shoot the video yourself or use graphics/animations to make the video. TikTok has a plethora of built-in editing tools, effects, and music tracks that can help you finalize and polish your video.
