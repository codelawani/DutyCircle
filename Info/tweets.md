## Day 1
Of course! Here's a catchy tweet that encapsulates your idea and sparks curiosity:

"Ever felt the weight of unchecked to-do lists and no one to push you? 📝💡 What if there was an app where your tasks meet accountability from a circle of peers? Excited to announce I'm building just that: #DutyCircle! Because every goal deserves a cheer squad. 🚀 Would you use it?"

This tweet highlights the pain point (unchecked to-do lists) and introduces your solution while also seeking engagement and feedback.

My friend @zee_knows did this whole frontend for me and she still thinks that she's not job ready 😭


1. **User Engagement**: The public accountability feature is a unique selling point that can help DutyCircle stand out from other task management apps. The public feed and circles(future plan) can help users connect with each other and form a community.
