### Nudge Feature:

The "nudge" feature is a mechanism to remind users of their pending tasks or to encourage them to stay on track. It plays a crucial role in keeping users engaged and accountable.

**Implementation**:
1. **Triggered Nudges**: Allow users in the same Accountability Circle to nudge each other. If one user notices a friend's task is nearing its deadline, they can send a nudge as a friendly reminder.
2. **Automated Nudges**: The system automatically sends nudges based on specific criteria, like if a task is 24 hours from its deadline and still pending.

3. **Nudge Limit**: To prevent spam or annoyance, limit the number of nudges a user can send or receive in a day.

4. **Notification**: A nudge can be a simple push notification or in-app message with a customizable message like "Hey, don't forget about your task!".

**Why Necessary**:
1. **Engagement**: It's a gentle push to keep users engaged with their tasks.
2. **Accountability**: Enhances the accountability aspect of the app by allowing peers to remind each other.
3. **Reduction in Task Negligence**: Increases the likelihood that users will attend to their tasks before the deadline.

**When Required**:
1. **Close to Deadlines**: When a task's deadline is approaching and it hasn't been marked as complete.
2. **Long Inactivity**: If a user hasn't checked the app in a while, a nudge can remind them to stay engaged.
3. **Requested by Friends**: Users can manually nudge friends if they notice a task has been pending for a long time.

### Complete MVP Breakdown with PostgreSQL:

1. **User Profiles & Authentication**:
   - Register, login, and manage profiles.
   - Password encryption and token-based authentication.

2. **Task Management**:
   - CRUD operations for tasks.
   - Task properties: title, description, deadline, privacy settings, category, consequence for not completing.
   - Task status tracking: pending, completed, etc.
   
3. **Public Feed & Accountability Circle**:
   - Display public tasks.
   - Interact with tasks (thumbs-up, nudge, comment).
   - Add friends to the Accountability Circle.
   - Send and accept friend requests.

4. **Nudge Feature**:
   - Manually triggered nudges by friends.
   - Automated nudges based on task status and deadlines.

5. **Task Completion Process**:
   - User marks a task as completed.
   - If the task has a reflection/feedback prompt, the user can provide input.
   - Notifications sent to Accountability Circle members about task completion.
   - Completed tasks are visually distinguished in all feeds.
   - If a task is not completed by its deadline and has set consequences, the consequence is executed (e.g., a public post about missing the task).
   
6. **Feedback Loop**:
   - After task completion, users can reflect on their experience.
   - Other users can see these reflections if the task is set to public.

7. **Backend (PostgreSQL)**:
   - Tables for users, tasks, friendships, nudges, and interactions.
   - Proper relational links between tables (e.g., foreign keys linking tasks to users).
   - Robust querying capabilities to fetch, filter, and display data.

8. **Notifications & Alerts**:
   - For nudges, task completions, new friend requests, etc.
   - Users can view and clear notifications.



The outlined MVP structure, combined with the proposed features, offers a comprehensive approach for your accountability application. The relational nature of PostgreSQL will handle the interconnected data efficiently, making it easier to expand and scale the app in the future.
